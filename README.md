## Hand Gesture Virtual Mouse

**A Python-based application that transforms hand movements into mouse actions.**

Leveraging computer vision with OpenCV and MediaPipe for real-time hand detection and tracking, this project provides a hands-free interface. PyAutoGUI ensures precise control over the system mouse, allowing users to navigate and interact with their computer using intuitive gestures. 

**Key features:**

* **Real-time hand tracking:** Accurately detects and follows hand movements.
* **Gesture recognition:** Interprets hand positions for various mouse actions.
* **Mouse control:** Simulates mouse movements, clicks, and scrolling.
* **Additional functionalities:** Potential for volume control (pycaw), screen brightness adjustment (screen-brightness-control), and more.

This application offers a unique and accessible way to interact with computers for individuals with disabilities or those seeking a novel user experience.
